## **üó®Ô∏è Problem Statement** 
Create a **Java Swing** program that models a maximum of 100 bouncing balls on the screen. A **user click** should add additional bouncing balls to the screen. When the ball hits an edge, it should continue in the opposite direction.
 
## **üéÆ User Documentation**
Once the program has started, the user will be shown a blank, white screen. This is the JPanel that holds the bouncing balls created by the user.

</div>
Directions:
1. Left Click: Add new ball to screen
2. Right Click: Remove most recent ball
3. No more than 100 balls can be on screen, and no fewer than 0

A **left click**_ of the mouse (single-finger click on mouse track) will _create a new ball_ and add it to Executor service, which is set to execute by a timer in the panel's thread.

A **right click** of the mouse will _remove the most recently added ball_, and it will no longer be updated and painted in the EDT.

Here is what the program looks like with the balls:

**Packages:**
- [src](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/tree/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src?ref_type=heads): contains classes for gui components, mouse listener, and ball objects. Includes [BouncingBallFrame](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBallFrame.java?ref_type=heads), [BouncingBallPanel](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBallPanel.java?ref_type=heads), [BouncingBallMouseHandler](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBallMouseHandler.java?ref_type=heads), and [BouncingBall](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBall.java?ref_type=heads). [Main.java](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/Main.java?ref_type=heads) is also included inside of this package.

**Classes (in more depth as there is only the single package):**
- [BouncingBallFrame](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBallFrame.java?ref_type=heads): Parent frame for java swing application. No threads, simply holds the bouncing ball panel
- [BouncingBallPanel](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBallPanel.java?ref_type=heads): java swing jpanel to hold the bouncing balls. This runs on its own thread, which continuously repaints the screen by using a swing timer pointing to repaint(). 
- [BouncingBallMouseHandler](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBallMouseHandler.java?ref_type=heads): handles user interaction with mouse. Only implemented method is mousePressed(...).
- [BouncingBall](https://class-git.engineering.uiowa.edu/swd2024fall/mnkrueger/-/blob/master/oral_exam2/23_11_BouncingBalls_Medium/src/BouncingBall.java?ref_type=heads): single threaded class that handles the painting of a java swing oval, thread calculates the new position so that all balls move at the same time (concurrently rather than sequentially).
