## **üó®Ô∏è Problem Statement**
Create a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game that allows different player combinations: human vs. computer, human vs. human, and computer vs. computer. The game should display the board after each move, check for a winner or a tie, and end with a status message when the game concludes. Use **object-oriented programming** with classes for the board, and players.
 
## **üéÆ User Documentation**
When starting the program, the console will present the following message:

  <img src="./img/2.png" alt="Tic-tac-toe" width="300"/>
</div>

There are three game modes:
1. Multi Player: Play against a friend locally
2. Single Player: Play against a non-player computer 
3. Spectator: Watch two non-player computers play each other
4. EXIT GAME: exit program


## **1. Multi Player Directions:**
The game alternates between **Player1** (human) and **Player2** (human), requesting moves from each. Each human player must enter a valid 'row,col' pair into the system. There is a visual showing the current status of the board as well as the indexes representing each square in the 3x3 grid. Player1 goes first with Player2 following. The game ends when there is a three-in-a-row by either player or a scratch is achieved.

## **2. Single Player Directions:**
The game alternates between **Player1** (human) and **Player2** (computer), requesting moves from each. The human, Player1, must enter a valid 'row,col' pair into the system. The computer player 'thinks' and randomly places a marker on the board once it has randomly entered a valid 'row,col' pair. Do not use interact with the screen while the computer is 'thinking' as you may lose track of where you are in the console log. There is a visual showing the current status of the board as well as the indexes representing each square in the 3x3 grid. Player1 goes first with Player2 following. The game ends when there is a three-in-a-row by either player or a scratch is achieved.

## **3. Spectator Directions:**
The game alternates between **Player1** (computer) and **Player2** (computer), requesting moves from each. Both computer players 'think' and randomly place markers on the board once a randomly entered 'row,col' pair is entered. Do not use interact with the screen throughout this game as you may lose track of where you are in the console log. There is a visual showing the current status of the board as well as the indexes representing each square in the 3x3 grid. Player1 goes first with Player2 following. The game ends when there is a three-in-a-row by either player or a scratch is achieved.
