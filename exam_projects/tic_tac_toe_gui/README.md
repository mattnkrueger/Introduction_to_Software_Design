## **üó®Ô∏è Problem Statement**

Create a **GUI** for the popular '**TicTacToe**' game using **JavaFX**. In this project, correctly model the game logic of TicTacToe, and provide interactive GUI for user to play the game visually. The game should differentiate players visually & correctly track the winner of the game and previous games.

## **:video_game: User Documentation**

## Upon starting the game, the user will be presented the following GUI. Press 'Play Tic-Tac-Toe' to begin the game. If you are unfamiliar with the rules, you can take a quick look at the 'Help' button located in the navbar.
