## **üó®Ô∏è Problem Statement**

Create a **GUI** for the popular '**_Wordle_**' game using **JavaFX**. In this project, correctly model the game logic of Wordle, and provide interactive GUI for user to play the game visually. Colors of guess letter buttons should reflect guess completion, and user lives displayed.

## **üéÆ User Documentation**

Upon starting the game, the user will be presented the following GUI:

<div align="center">

![Game Start](img/2.png)
</div> 

Press 'Play Wordle' to begin the game. If you are unfamiliar with the rules, you can take a quick look at the 'Help' button located in the navbar.

Once in the game, the user will be shown this view, containing a 6x5 grid of squares.

<div align="center">

![Game View](img/3.png)
</div>
There are also 26 buttons representing a keyboard, with three additional icon buttons: **'clear'**: indicated by trashcan icon, this clears all guess letters in current row **'delete'**: indicated by backspace icon, this deletes the current index and moves back one spot **'enter'**: this submits the guess to the system Using these buttons, the user will interact with the Wordle game to construct and submit guesses.

Now that the game has begun, the user will have 6 guesses to enter a 5 letter word. Again, you are unfamiliar with the rules, I suggest you use the 'Help' button.

<div align="center">

![Help Screen](img/4.png)
</div>
If the word is not a 5 letter word, or if it is not inside of the 5 letter word dictionary, the guess will flash red for 0.5 seconds before allowing the user to submit a new guess.

<div align="center">

![Invalid Word](img/5.png)
</div>
After the word is guessed correctly (win) or 6 incorrect guesses (loss), the game over screen will be shown, providing the solution and user guesses.
