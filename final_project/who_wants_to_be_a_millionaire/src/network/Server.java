/**
 * Class:
 *     Server
 *
 * Purpose:
 *     The Server class is endpoint of server for the socket connection.
 *     There is only one instance of this class, but it utilizes multithreading to allow for >1 Client connections
 *     creating a multithreaded server (MTS).
 *
 *     This Server class is responsible for the following:
 *             1. MTS - servicing threads with clients by utilizing ArrayList, ExecutorService, and Worker objects to do this.
 *             2. TODO - db communicaiton
 *             2. TODO - game logic communication
 *
 * Multithreaded:
 *     Yes. This is a multithreaded class with Worker threads processed concurrently.
 *
 * @see Worker
 * @see Client
